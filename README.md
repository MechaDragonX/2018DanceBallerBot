# 2018 Dance Baller Bot
This is a version of my 2018BallerBot code that allows the robot to be controlled using a dance pad used in games such as Dance Dance Revolution.

The 2018 Baller Bot code was created by @MechaDragonX and @sejudav20 under the guidance of @TwoTau, in order to be part of FRC Team 2976: Skyline Spartabots' software team.
